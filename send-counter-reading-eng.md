	⚠ NOTE. If the link **Submit Meter Readings** is missing, it means there is no customer number connected to your personal account. If this is the case, [connect relevant customer numbers](https://github.com/ded-ared/gosuslugi/blob/main/connect-customer-number.md#how-to-connect-customer-number "здесь должна быть ссылка на инструкцию по подключению ЛС, но это уже вне рамок данного задания") to your account and continue from the step 2.

3. In the pop-up window, fill in the **Current Reading** and **Readout Date** fields as required.

4. Click **Save**.

A little note.
Unfortunately I can't describe situations when something goes wrong because I worked with my personal account and I wouldn't like to play around with it.
